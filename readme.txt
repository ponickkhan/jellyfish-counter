Creates a widget containing an odometer style counter that can display either
a static value or animate up to a set predefined value. Great for tracking totals etc.

== Description ==

This plugin for WordPress does not count jellyfish, it adds a widget that 
displays a static or animated odometer style counter that can display a set 
value or can animate between a starting and ending value.

A great visual effect for travel blogs or any website that wants to display a
running total of anything. 

You can have as many counters as you wish, all can have individual settings for
totals and appearance.

The counters are created via css and require no external graphics files.


Demo

You can see a counter in action at http://sharkaroo.net/map
Using an animated counter adds visual and narrative impact to an otherwise 
static value.

This plugin uses a modified version of a javascript odometer class written by 
Gavin Brock http://www.brock-family.org/gavin/software/web/


==Usage==

Add a counter widget to your sidebar and adjust the settings to suit your 
requirements. If you specify different start and end values the counter will
count upwards when the page loads until it reaches the ending value.

If you just want a static counter make the start and end the same value or make
the end value lower than the starting value.

You can configure the digit height, width and font as well as animation
speed and "bustedness" (misalignment of the digits). 



== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ 
directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from 
Plugins page. Go to the widgets admin page to add a counter widget, each widget
