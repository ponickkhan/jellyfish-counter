Creates a widget containing an odometer style counter that can display either
a static value or animate up to a set predefined value. Great for tracking totals etc.

== Description ==

This plugin for WordPress adds a widget that displays a static or animated odometer
style counter that can display a set value or can animate between a starting and
ending value.

A great visual effect for travel blogs or any website that wants to display a
running total of anything. 

You can have as many counters as you wish, all can have individual settings for
totals and appearance.

The counters are created via css and require no external graphics files.


Demo

Using an animated counter adds visual and narrative impact to an otherwise 
static value.

This plugin uses a javascript odometer class written by Gavin Brock

==Usage==

Add a counter widget to your sidebar and configure the settings as desired.

If you'd like to add additional styling to the counter, a border for example,
just add the relevant css to your theme stylesheet. Each counter is displayed 
in a div with the id of odometer-# where # is the id of the widget, additionally 
the counters have the "odometer" class. Size, font, and appearance of the counter 
itself is controlled via the widget settings.

directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from 
Plugins page. Go to the widgets admin page to add a counter widget, each widget 
has it's own settings.
