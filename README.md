A plugin for WordPress that adds retro odometer style animated counters to any WordPress post or page. Unlimited amount of counters, widget and shortcode support.

## Example

Live demo at http://strawberryjellyfish.com/wordpress-plugins/jellyfish-counter/

## Installation

If you want to actually use this on a WordPress site it will be
easier to just install via the WordPress plugin admin pages.
Just search for "Jellyfish Counter Widget" and install.

If you want to install manually, create a folder in called jellyfish-counter-widget in your wp-plugins folder then copy the contents of trunk into it. Then go to the plugins page on your WordPress admin and activate.

## Further info

Consult the main readme in trunk or take a look at the plugin homepage at http://strawberryjellyfish.com/wordpress-plugins/jellyfish-counter/

## Want to contribute?

Feel free to use github to fork or pull request, the main WordPress SVN repository is just a mirror of this as I prefer to use git for many uninteresting reasons :)
